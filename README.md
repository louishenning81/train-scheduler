# train-scheduler

### This is Louis Henning's Train Scheduler assignment
https://louishenning81.github.io/train-scheduler/

This assignment called for the following items:

1. Create a front end page that displays a jumbotron header with a dynamically updated table below the jummbotron and an input form below that.
2. Using Javascript and a clicklistener, link data that is submitted through the form on the page with a Firebase database by pushing the data to this database as data is submitted.
3. Regularly cycle through the data that has been pushed to the Firebase database and then push each submitted record to the table on the html page.
4. Use moment.js to calculate train times and minutes from next train in additional fields and display those on the html page.

Things I struggled with:
1. I had a bit of trouble figuring out where to insert the moment.js values onto the page.
2.  I also had some issues with getting the right commands and displaying fields in the right formats
